          <strong><u>The Oceans</u></strong> cover over 70% of the Earth's
          surface and are home to millions of marine species. They play a vital
          role in regulating our planet's climate and supporting life as we know
          it. <br /><br />
          This interactive website offers a unique learning experience designed
          to
          <strong>raise environmental awareness</strong> and *explore the
          secrets of the oceans* through visuals, scientific facts, and engaging
          activities. <br /><br />
          Our mission is to <strong>inspire future generations</strong> to
          protect this global treasure and understand the *harmful effects of
          plastic pollution, global warming, and overfishing* on marine
          ecosystems. <br /><br />
